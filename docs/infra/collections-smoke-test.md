## Latest Automated Run

- Date: `2026-04-12`
- Target database: `scriptony`
- Result: `PASS`

## Verified

[x] 1. All 5 collections exist in Appwrite - `styleProfiles` - `renderJobs` - `imageTasks` - `guideBundles` - `stageDocuments`

[x] 2. All collection attributes from the ticket JSON specs exist

[x] 3. All required ticket indexes exist

[x] 4. `shots` contains the new fields - `blenderSourceVersion` - `blenderSyncRevision` - `guideBundleRevision` - `styleProfileId` - `styleProfileRevision` - `renderRevision` - `lastBlenderSyncAt` - `lastPreviewAt` - `latestGuideBundleId` - `latestRenderJobId` - `acceptedRenderJobId`

[x] 5. One valid test document was created and deleted in each collection - `styleProfiles` - `renderJobs` - `imageTasks` - `guideBundles` - `stageDocuments`

[x] 6. Required fields are enforced - For each collection, one invalid create with a missing required field was rejected as expected

## Command

Run the same smoke test again with:

```bash
./tickets/ticket-01-database-schema/smoke-test.sh
```

or

```bash
node tickets/ticket-01-database-schema/smoke-test.mjs
```

## Notes

- The smoke test uses real Appwrite create/delete document operations.
- Test documents are removed again after successful creation.
- This test verifies schema availability and basic write enforcement, not application-level business logic.
