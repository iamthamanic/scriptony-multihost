## 7. Data Persistence

### 7.1 Storage Strategy

#### 7.1.1 Appwrite + Scriptony HTTP functions

**Architecture:** Three-tier (SPA → Scriptony `functions/*` → Appwrite Databases & Storage)

**Server:**

- Deployed Node (or host-specific) handlers under `functions/` (e.g. `scriptony-projects`, `scriptony-auth`, …)
- Frontend calls them via `VITE_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` / `VITE_APPWRITE_FUNCTIONS_BASE_URL` and `src/lib/api-gateway.ts`
- Authorization: user **JWT from Appwrite** (`Bearer`), plus optional public token where configured

**Database / storage:**

- **Appwrite Databases** collections mirror former relational entities (projects, shots, timeline nodes, …)
- **Appwrite Storage** buckets for images, audio, etc. (server-side API key only)

**Data stored (examples):**

- Project metadata
- Project content (acts, scenes, chapters)
- Beat configurations
- AI chat history
- User preferences

#### 7.1.2 localStorage

**Used For:**

- Track heights in Playbook
- UI state (zoom level, playhead position)
- Temporary drafts
- Session-specific settings

**Implementation:**

- Per-project keys
- Automatic save on change
- Fallback to defaults if corrupted

### 7.2 Data Models

#### 7.2.1 Project Structure

```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: "film" | "book";
  created: Date;
  modified: Date;
  settings: ProjectSettings;
  acts: Act[];
  beats: Beat[];
}

interface ProjectSettings {
  actCount: number;
  wordsPerMinute?: number; // For book projects
  beatTemplate?: string;
  // ... other settings
}
```

#### 7.2.2 Beat Structure

```typescript
interface Beat {
  id: string;
  pct_from: number; // 0-100
  pct_to: number; // 0-100
  label: string;
  color?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

#### 7.2.3 Track Heights (localStorage)

```typescript
interface TrackHeights {
  [projectId: string]: {
    [trackId: string]: number; // Height in pixels
  };
}
```

## 8. Performance Requirements

### 8.1 Performance SLAs

**Target: "Übertrieben schnell"**

**Key Metrics:**

- Initial page load: < 1.5s
- Timeline render: < 100ms
- Beat resize interaction: < 16ms (60fps)
- Playhead drag: < 16ms (60fps)
- Editor typing latency: < 50ms

### 8.2 Automatic Optimization

**SLA Monitoring:**

- Performance metrics tracked automatically
- Alerts when SLAs are not met
- Automatic code optimization triggers

**Optimization Strategies:**

- React.memo for timeline components
- Virtualization for long timelines
- Debounced resize handlers
- RequestAnimationFrame for animations
- Lazy loading for heavy components

### 8.3 Implementation Details

- Performance budgets enforced
- Lighthouse CI integration
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Automatic rollback on performance regression

---

## 9. Deployment & Infrastructure

### 9.1 Deployment Strategy

**Functions:**

- Deploy `functions/` services to your host (e.g. Appwrite Functions or a Node gateway)
- Server env: `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`, `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`, `APPWRITE_API_KEY`, optional bucket/database IDs

**Frontend:**

- `npm run build` → static `build/`
- Set `VITE_APPWRITE_*` and functions base URL at build time (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`)

### 9.2 Environment Variables

**Frontend (`VITE_*`):**

- `VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`, `VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` or `VITE_APPWRITE_FUNCTIONS_BASE_URL`
- Redirect URLs for auth

**Security:**

- Appwrite API keys and function secrets only on the server
- Browser uses Appwrite project ID + endpoint only (no service key in the SPA)

---

## 10. Technical Stack

- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **State Management:** React hooks + context

## 12. Known Constraints & Design Decisions

### 12.1 Beat Display

**Decision:** Beats ONLY shown in Timeline view
**Rationale:**

- Avoid clutter in writing interface
- Separation of planning vs. writing modes
- Timeline is dedicated planning tool

### 12.2 Ripple Editing Asymmetry

**Decision:** Right handle ripples, left handle doesn't
**Rationale:**

- Matches industry-standard video editors (CapCut, Premiere, DaVinci)
- Most natural for users
- Prevents accidental timeline shifts when trimming starts

### 12.3 Database Migrations

**Constraint:** No DDL/migration files in codebase
**Rationale:**

- Single KV table sufficient for prototyping
- Admins manage schema/data via Appwrite Console (or custom tooling)
- Avoid sync issues between code and DB schema
- Flexible schema in KV store

### 12.4 Manual Edge Function Deployment

**Decision:** Copy-paste deployment via Dashboard (no CLI)
**Rationale:**

- User preference
- Better control over deployment timing
- Visual verification before deploy
- Clear deployment audit trail
