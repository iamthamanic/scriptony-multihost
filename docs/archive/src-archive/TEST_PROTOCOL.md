## Phase 1: Automatic Verification ✅

### 1.1 Console Logging Test

**Steps:**

1. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate to Console tab
3. Open a project with Timeline/Structure

**Expected Output for FilmDropdown:**

```javascript
🚀 [FilmDropdown] Performance Stats: {
  totalItems: {
    acts: <number>,
    sequences: <number>,
    scenes: <number>,
    shots: <number>
  },
  visibleItems: {
    sequences: <number>,
    scenes: <number>,
    shots: <number>
  },
  renderReduction: {
    sequences: "<percentage>%",
    scenes: "<percentage>%",
    shots: "<percentage>%"
  }
}
```

**Expected Output for BookDropdown:**

```javascript
📚 [BookDropdown] Performance Stats: {
  totalItems: {
    acts: <number>,
    sequences: <number>,
    scenes: <number>,
    totalWords: <number>
  },
  visibleItems: {
    sequences: <number>,
    scenes: <number>
  },
  renderReduction: {
    sequences: "<percentage>%",
    scenes: "<percentage>%"
  },
  avgStats: {
    wordsPerScene: <number>,
    scenesPerSequence: <number>
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ Console logs appear only in Development mode
- ✅ All numbers are positive integers
- ✅ visibleItems < totalItems
- ✅ renderReduction > 0%

---

### 1.2 Hook Integration Test

**Test FilmDropdown Hook:**

```typescript
// Check that optimized hook is working
console.log("optimized.stats:", optimized.stats);
console.log(
  "optimized.getSequencesForAct:",
  typeof optimized.getSequencesForAct,
);
console.log(
  "optimized.getScenesForSequence:",
  typeof optimized.getScenesForSequence,
);
console.log("optimized.getShotsForScene:", typeof optimized.getShotsForScene);
```

**Expected:**

- ✅ `stats` is an object with all metrics
- ✅ All getXXX functions are of type 'function'
- ✅ No errors in console

**Test BookDropdown Hook:**

```typescript
console.log("optimized.stats:", optimized.stats);
console.log(
  "optimized.getSequencesForAct:",
  typeof optimized.getSequencesForAct,
);
console.log(
  "optimized.getScenesForSequence:",
  typeof optimized.getScenesForSequence,
);
console.log(
  "optimized.calculateSequenceWordCount:",
  typeof optimized.calculateSequenceWordCount,
);
```

**Expected:**

- ✅ `stats` includes totalWords and avgStats
- ✅ All functions are defined
- ✅ No errors in console
